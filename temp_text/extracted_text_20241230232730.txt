CRP-QUANTITATIVE TEST
PARAMETER RESULTS BIOLOGICAL REF RANGE METHOD
CRP-QUANTITATIVE, Serum 0.3 1-5 mg/l Imm. Turbidimetry

Kindly correlate clinically.
Advice : Repeat estimation with a fresh sample, if clinically indicated.

Interpretation:
CRP elevations are nonspecific and may be useful for the detection of systemic inflammatory processes like;
¢ To assess treatment of bacterial infections with antibiotics
¢ To differentiate between active and inactive forms of disease with concurrent infection
¢ Postoperative monitoring & to determine the presence of postoperative complications at an early stage, such as infected wounds,
thrombosis, and pneumonia.

Clinical Significance:

¢ C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, a protein made by the liver and released into the blood within a few hours after
tissue injury, the start of an infection, or other cause of inflammation.

¢ The test measures the amount of CRP in the blood and can be valuable in detecting inflammation due to acute conditions or in
monitoring disease activity in chronic conditions.

¢ — In normal healthy individuals CRP is a trace protein, after onset of an acute phase response the serum CRP concentration rises rapidly
and extensively. Alterations are detectable within 6 to 8 hours and the peak value is reached within 24 to 48 hours.

¢ Levels of up to thousand fold the normal value are associated with severe stimuli such as myocardial infarction, major trauma,
surgery, or malignant neoplasms.

¢ — CRP has a half-life of only a few hours, making it an ideal tool for clinical monitoring. Postoperative monitoring of CRP levels of
patients indicates either the normal recovery process (decreasing levels to normal) or unexpected complications (persisting high
levels).

¢ Persistence of a high serum CRP concentration is usually a grave prognostic sign which generally indicates the presence of an
uncontrolled infection.

¢ CRP determination may replace the classical determination of Erythrocytes Sedimentation Rate (ESR), due to its prompt response to
changes in disease activity and its good correlation to ESR.

Reflex Tests: Complement, Procalcitonin

Limitations of the test:
The CRP test is not diagnostic of any condition, but it can be used together with signs and symptoms and other tests to evaluate an individual
for an acute or chronic inflammatory condition.

NT-proBNP
PARAMETER RESULTS BIOLOGICAL REF RANGE METHOD
NT-proBNP, Serum 308 <450 pg/ml CLIA

Clinical Significance: Use in the quantitative determination of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) NT-ProBNP is a marker of
atrial & ventricular distension due to increased intracardiac pressure, hence it is used as an aid in the diagnosis of CHF. The diagnostic strength
of NT-ProBNP is their high sensitivity for ruling out heart failure

Intended Use:
¢ NT-proBNP determination is used to identify patients with suspected left ventricular dysfunction. It particularly helps to differentiate
between cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea.
¢ NT-proBNP is also a predictive marker of mortality for patients with cardiac insufficiency or coronary artery disease or for patients at

risk of coronary insufficiency.
¢ — Variations in NT-proBNP concentration may be useful to monitor the efficacy of therapy for left ventricular dysfunction.

Interpretation:

¢ NT pro-BNP value <125 pg/mL exclude cardiac dysfunction with a high level of certainty in patients presenting with dyspnea, As the
value increases heart failure becomes more likely.

¢ — Higher levels e than expected are seen in Increasing age, ACS ,Renal insufficiency , RV Dysfunction, Atrial fibrillation , Pulmonary
hypertension, Pulmonary embolism , Anemia, Sepsis and Mitral Regurgitation ,

¢ Lower levels than expected are seen in Obesity, Pulomanary edema, Pericarditis/tamponade, Genetic polymorphism

Limitations:

¢ Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies that could react in immunoassays to give falsely elevated or depressed results

¢ — NT-pro-BNP values need to be interpreted in conjunction with the medical history, clinical findings.

¢ — Lack of NT-ProBNP elevation has been reported if Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is very acute (first hour) or if there is Ventricular
inflow obstruction

Iron studies
PARAMETER RESULTS BIOLOGICAL REF RANGE METHOD
IRON, Serum 218.0 50-170 pg/dL Colorimetric
UIBC (measured), Serum 170.9 135-392 ug/dL Calculated
TOTAL IRON BINDING 388.9 250-425 g/dL Colorimetric
CAPACITY (TIBC), Serum
TRANSFERRIN, Serum 302.4 250-380 mg/dl Imm. Turbidimetry
TRANSFERRIN SATURATION, 51.1 15-45 % Calculated
Serum
FERRITIN, Serum 20.6 10-291 ng/ml CLIA

Intended Use: This test is used to evaluate iron metabolism in patients when iron deficiency, overload, or poisoning is suspected.

Clinical Significance:
Abnormal levels of iron are characteristic of many diseases, including iron-deficiency anemia and hemochromatosis. As much as 70% of the iron
in the body is found in the hemoglobin of the red blood cells (RBCs). The other 30% is stored in the form of ferritin and hemosiderin. Iron is
supplied by the diet. About 10% of the ingested iron is absorbed in the small intestine and transported to the plasma. There the iron is bound
to a globulin protein called transferrin and carried to the bone marrow for incorporation into hemoglobin. Usually about one third of the
transferrin is being used to transport iron. Because of this, the blood serum has considerable extra iron-binding capacity, which is the
Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity (UIBC). The serum ferritin study is a good indicator of available iron stores in the body. Ferritin, the major
iron-storage protein, is normally present in the serum in concentrations directly related to iron storage.
Test Interpretation:
¢ Serum iron is increased in hemosiderosis, hemolytic anemias, thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, hepatitis, acute hepatic necrosis,
hemochromatosis, inappropriate iron therapy, and iron poisoning.
¢ Serum iron is decreased in cases of insufficient dietary iron, chronic blood loss, inadequate absorption of iron, impaired release of iron
stores (commonly observed in inflammation), infection, and chronic diseases.
¢ — Serum TIBC is done in conjunction with serum iron levels in the evaluation and diagnosis of anemia.
° lron deficiency anemia is characterized by a decreased serum iron, increased TIBC or transferrin, and a decreased transferrin
saturation.
¢ — Serum TIBC is increased in iron deficiency and decreased in anemia of chronic disease.
Limitations of the test
¢ — Recent blood transfusions or recent ingestion of a meal containing high iron content may increase serum iron and ferritin levels.
¢ Hemolytic diseases may be associated with an artificially high iron content.
¢ — Drugs that may cause increased iron levels include chloramphenicol, dextran, estrogens, ethanol, iron preparations, methyldopa, and
oral contraceptives.
¢ Drugs that may cause decreased iron levels include adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cholestyramine, chloramphenicol, colchicine,
deferoxamine, methicillin, and testosterone.
¢ Drugs that may cause increased TIBC levels include fluorides and oral contraceptives.
¢ — Drugs that may cause decreased TIBC levels include ACTH and chloramphenicol.
¢ Diurnal variation is seen with iron levels low in mid afternoon and very low near mid night.
¢ — Acute and chronic inflammatory conditions and Gaucher disease can falsely increase ferritin levels
